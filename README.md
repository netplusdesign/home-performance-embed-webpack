# home-performance-embed-webpack

Simple app to load date from [home-performance-flask-api](https://github.com/netplusdesign/home-performance-flask-api) and present it in tables for use on my [uphillhouse](uphillhouse.com) blog.

Used this as an opportunity to learn more about Typescript, modules and Webpack.

There's also a [simple](https://github.com/netplusdesign/home-performance-embed-simple) version.

## Requires

- Webpack
- Typescript
- Handlebars
- Momentjs

First get Node.

Then close this repo and run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- Open index.html in a browser.
